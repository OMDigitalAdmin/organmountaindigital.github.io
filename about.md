## 🏜️ What Is Organ Mountain Digital?

Organ Mountain Digital is a community-first media platform built to amplify local events, spotlight small businesses, and elevate nonprofit and veteran voices in Las Cruces and southern New Mexico.

We're powered by people — not corporations. This space is built for you, by a local veteran and educator who believes in accessible, grassroots media.

## 🎯 Why We Exist

Las Cruces is full of stories, talent, and untold events — but we noticed:

- Community calendars are fragmented  
- Local creators and nonprofits struggle for visibility  
- Big platforms charge too much or show irrelevant ads  

Organ Mountain Digital fills that gap with **free listings, low-cost promos, and direct community control**.

## 💡 What We Offer

- 🗓️ Community event listings  
- 🪖 Veteran-owned business directory  
- 📣 Sponsored posts + nonprofit features  
- 🧠 Tech, STEM, and digital literacy outreach (powered by Roadrunner STEM)

We’re not just media — we’re a launchpad for community connection and digital equity.

## 🙋 Who’s Behind It

Organ Mountain Digital was founded and is operated by a U.S. military veteran, parent, and community tech educator — someone who understands the real gaps families, creators, and small businesses face.

We believe the best way to build a strong digital community is to **center real people, not algorithms.**
