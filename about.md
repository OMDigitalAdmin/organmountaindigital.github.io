  <h2>🎯 Why We Exist</h2>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>📅 Community calendars are fragmented</li>
    <li>🔍 Local creators and nonprofits struggle for visibility</li>
    <li>💸 Big platforms charge too much or show irrelevant ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Organ Mountain Digital fills that gap with <strong>free listings, low-cost promos, and direct community control</strong>.</p>
