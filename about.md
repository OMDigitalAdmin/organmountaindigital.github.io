## What is Organ Mountain Digital?

Organ Mountain Digital is a community-first media platform built to amplify local events, spotlight small businesses, and provide visibility for nonprofits and veteran-owned ventures in Las Cruces.

## Why We Exist

We noticed a gap — community stories and events were scattered or going unheard. This platform was created to give everyone in Las Cruces a voice and a place to share what's happening.

## What We Offer

- Free listings for local nonprofits  
- Low-cost community ads and sponsorship options  
- Monthly features for veteran-owned businesses  
- An open community calendar anyone can submit to  
- Space for local creators, events, and announcements

## Who’s Behind It

Organ Mountain Digital was founded and is operated by a U.S. military veteran who believes in digital equity, local storytelling, and accessible platforms for all.

We are **powered by voices, not corporations.** Every listing, story, and event comes from the people who live here — not outside advertisers or algorithms.
